# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:
A parameter basically defines the function. The parameter tells us what information will be used to create an argument for the function. 

Researched answer:
A parameter is what is used to define the argument, while the argument is what is actually passed through the function. Parameters are defined using variables, that have to be setup prior to passing an argument through the function. The values that are defined in the parameters tell the function what data to use to when the function is declared. Multiple parameters can be used for the function argument. The argument is invoked when those values are passed through the argument. The argument is the actual value of the parameter. If the argument and parameters do not match, then Javascript will return an error or undefined.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:
The .map method requires key/function, index, array, and value. The key is required.

Researched answer:
The .map method requires the predefined parameters value, index and array. The value is the required parameter as it provides the method with the array that will be used to iterate over. The .map method have to have at least one value. The index shows the current location during the iteration. The array shows where the function was called on.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:
The .map method and .filter both iterate through an array 

Researched answer:
The .map and .filter methods both iterate through an array, however; the .map method returns a new array of the same length, while the .filter method returns a new array with only the values requested in the iniital argument. Filter also needs an evaluation, .map does not. Filter iterates over the entire array, then checks it against the return value, then returns that requested value. Map iterates over the entire array and returns a new array. 

4. What is iteration?

Your answer:
Iteration is the process of repeating through an array or string

Researched answer:
Iteration is the process of repeating over and over again until a condition is met. Iteration works on certain types of data, specifically strings and arrays. Iteration requires a starting point, a condition that has to be met, and an action that will happen once that condition is met. Iteration is useful when you want to execute a function many times using different sets of data each time.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer:
Objects are a data type that hold key/value pairs. Classes are are the template for objects.

Researched answer:
Classes are essentially a description or definition for what the Object will be. It is the outline or building block for the object. Once the class is written, it can be used to create an object. Objects are the product of the data compiled in the class. 

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer:
No clue! :)

Researched answer:
Hoisting is a default behavior in Javascript that automatically moves declarations to the top. This normally happens before executing the code, giving the coder an advantage to use the function or variable before declaring it. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: A general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer.

2. Spread operator: A method that allows a coder to quickly copy all or part of the an existing array or object into another array or object.

3. React: A Javascript library for building user interfaces based on UI components

4. React props: Inputs used in React similar to functions used in JavaScript

5. DOM events: Allows JavaScript to register different event handlers on elements in an HTML document
